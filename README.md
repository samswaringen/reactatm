# React ATM
Made a basic atm react app

## Project Path
* Created own atm app from scratch. We were given starter code but I accessed that after starting this and used it for some reference.
* Wanted to make it as close to regular ATM without having a database for storing values
* allow user to pick between withdraw or deposit
* tracks account balance up top and gives history on the right side 
* added quick cash withdraw feature and other amount withdraw
* atm will alert user if they are tring to withdraw more funds then they have and prevent it from happening
* react tracks state of withdraw/deposit values and account balance

## Future Updates
* Need to style which I will in coming week
* make account History look better wiht more readable text
* would like to learn mongo to store database info to make this act more like an atm with pin access and retaining account balance for different users

## Credits
* MIT xPro course
* Codevolution on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC80PWRj_ZU8Zu0HSMNVwKWw Best React tutorials I have found
